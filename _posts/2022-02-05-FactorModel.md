# __Input of M-V Model__

+ Suppose there are n stocks, then m-v model requires "n mean values, n variance, $\frac {n(n-1)}2$ covariances"
Total of $2n + \frac  {n(n-1)}2$ parameters are required

+ When n is large, this is a very large set of required values

# __Factor Models__

+ Factor : randomness of n stocks can be traced back to a smaller number of basic sources of randomness that influence the individual returns

+ Factor model leads to simplified structure for the covariance among assets

+ For commom stocks, the factors might be the size of a company, GDP, unemployment rate, etc.

## __Single Factor Model__
$$
y_i = a_i + b_if + e_i
$$

+ $e_i$ : Error 
with $ E(e_i) = 0 $

+ Why Factor Model is better?

    + we know the value of $a_i$, and $b_i$, the model can be used to estimate $y_i$
    + Without a factor model, the hours studied will be have to be estimated every time.

+ The $b_i$'s are termed factor loadings because they measure the sensitivity of the return to the factor

+ Single-factor model can be viewed grapgically as defining a linear fit

+ If we know the model, we can predict that the data points will fall near the line

$$
r_i = a_i + b_if + e_i
$$
$$
E(stock\  i)  = a_i + b_i\overline f
$$
$$
var(stock\ i) = b_i^2\sigma_f^2 + \sigma_{e_i}^2
$$
$$
cov(stock\ i, stock\ j ) = b_ib_j\sigma_f^2
$$

+ By using a single factor model, we just need a total 3n+2 parameters  

# __Single-Factor Model : Portfolios__

$$
r = \sum_{i=1}^nw_ia_i + \sum_{i=1}^nw_ib_if + \sum_{i=1}^nw_ie_i
$$

## Diversification
+ let's assume that $var(e_i) = s^2 \ for \ all \ i$. Then for an equally-weighteed portfolio, $w_i=\frac1n$.

$$
\sigma_e^2 = \frac1ns^2
$$
Hence, $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\sigma_e^2 = 0$

+ So in a well diversified portfolio, the error term in the factor equation is small.

# __CAPM as a Factor Model__

##__Single factormodel__

$r_i = a_i + b_if + e_i$

+ Assume that the single factor is the market rate of return $r_M$
+ We can also express the returns as excess returns 

$r_i -r_f= a_i + b_i(r_M - r_f) + e_i$

+ Single Factor Model is similar to _CAPM_, except _CAPM_ predicst that $\alpha_i = 0 $
+ CAPM is not derived from a factor model
+ Single Factor model is more general than CAPM, because it allows $\alpha$ to be nonzero
