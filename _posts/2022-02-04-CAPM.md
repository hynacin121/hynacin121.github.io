# __Capital Market Line__
+ CML Shows the relation between the expected rate of return and risk of return for efficient assets or portfolios
+ CML states that $ r = r_f + \frac{r_M-r_f}{\sigma_M}\sigma$ where $r_M$ and $\sigma_M$ are the expected value and standard deviation of the market rate of return, and r and $\sigma$ are for an arbitrary efficient asset

# __CAPM__

+ Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) : If market portfolio M is efficient, the expected return $r_i$ of any asset i satisfies

$$
r_i - r_f = \beta_i(r_M - r_f) \quad where \quad \beta_i = \frac {\sigma_{i,M}}{\sigma^2_M}
$$

+ Beta is all that need be known about the asset's risk when using the CAPM formula
+ CAPM says that the expected excess return of an asset is proportional to the expected excess return of the market portfolio, and proportionoality factor is $\beta$
+ CAPM also states that the expected excess return of an asset is directly proportional to its covariance with the market
+ Key points
    + CAPM changes concept of the risk of an asset from $\sigma$ to $\beta$
    + It is still true that we measure risk of a portfolio in term of $\sigma$, for assets, the proper measure is their  $\beta$'s
 
# __How to Calculate Beta and Expected Return of Asset by Python__ 
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import optimize
from datetime import datetime
%matplotlib inline

try:
    import pandas_datareader.data as web
except:
    %pip install pip pandas-datareader
    import pandas_datareader.data as web
  
```


```python
def Asset(ticker, start, end, interval):
    return(web.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start, end, interval = interval))['Adj Close']

def beta(asset):
    CovBetweenMktandAsset = np.cov(MarketPortfolio, asset)    
    return(CovBetweenMktandAsset[0,1]/CovBetweenMktandAsset[0,0]) 

def ExpectedReturn(beta):
    ExpectedReturn = RiskFreeRate.mean() + beta * (MarketPortfolio.mean() -RiskFreeRate.mean())
    return(ExpectedReturn)
```


```python
RiskFreeRate = Asset("^TNX", '2001-01-01', '2021-12-31', 'm').pct_change().dropna()
MarketPortfolio = Asset("^GSPC", '2001-01-01', '2021-12-31', 'm').pct_change().dropna()
asset1 = Asset("aapl", '2001-01-01', '2021-12-31', 'm').pct_change().dropna()
```


```python
b = beta(asset1)

b

```




    1.2334810221586363




```python
ExpectedReturn = RiskFreeRate.mean() + b * (MarketPortfolio.mean() -RiskFreeRate.mean())

ExpectedReturn

# __The Security Market Line__

+ CAPM formula can be expressed in graphical form by regarding the formular as a linear relationship
+ SML expresses the risk-reward structure of assets according to the CAPM

# __Systematic Risk__

+ CAPM implies a special structural property for the returns of an asset
+ This property provides further insight as to why beta is the most important measure of risk

## $ r_i  = r_f + \beta_i(r_m -r_f) + \epsilon_i$
+ CAPM formula tells us several things about $\epsilon_i$
1)  Taking the expected value of above, CAPM says that $E(\epsilon_i)=0 $
2) Taking the correlation of above with $r_M$, it can be shown that $cov(\epsilon_i, r_M) = 0$
    + Therefore, we can write the variance as $\sigma^2_i = \beta^2_i\sigma^2_M + var(\epsilon_i)$
+ The first parts, $\beta^2_i \sigma^2_M$ is termed the systematic risk
    + This is the risk associated with the market as a whole
+ The second part, $var(\epsilon_i)$ is termed the nonsystematic or idiosyncratic risk
    + This risk is uncorrelated with the market

# __CAPM as a Pricing Theory__ #

+ Suppose that an asset is purchased at price P and later sold at price Q
    + Rate of Return :$r = \frac{Q-P}P = \frac QP - 1$
    + P is known, but Q is random.
    + Putting CAPM formual give $\frac{Q-P}P  = r_f + \beta (r_M - r_f)$
    + The Price of P of an asset with payoff Q is $P = \frac Q{1+r_f + \beta (r_M - r_f) }$
    + This formula looks similar to discounting a future amount.
    + In the deterministic case, it is appropriate to discount the future payment at interest rate $r_f$, using a factor of $\frac 1{(1+r_f)}$
    + In the random case, the appropriate interest rate is $r_f + \beta (r_M - r_f)$, which can be regarded as the risk-adjusted interest rate
